        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            A basic plate made for basic people. If you enjoy routine and being absolutely boring do I have the dish for you.
            This is done <em>Gordan</em> style, not that it will make it much better. Don't get me wrong, I love scrambled eggs. 
            This is just a dish for that type of personality. Original, so original you're not original. In fact you have millions of people just like you
            all pretending they're original and one-of-a-kind. It's a fantastic dish though.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Assembly</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients together</li>
            <li>Don't preheat your pan</li>
            <li>Crack desired amount of eggs into pan</li>
            <li>Cut 1 tbsp. butter and drop it into the pan with the eggs</li>
            <li>Turn on the heat, but keep it low</li>
            <li>Whisk those eggs with the butter, preferrably with a silicon spatula</li>
            <li>Don't stop whisking, let it heat up nice and slowly</li>
            <li>When the bottom starts to cook, remove pan from heat and keep whisking</li>
            <li>This is so the cooked bits get mixed in with the rest of the eggs and don't burn</li>
            <li>Repeat the last two steps without stopping the whisking until eggs are only slightly runny</li>
            <li>Once eggs are looking close to fully cooked but still shiny, slightly wet, turn off the heat</li>
            <li>Add your seasoning to taste and bam</li>
            <li>Gordan styled eggs baby</li>
        </ol>
