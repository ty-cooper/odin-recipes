        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            If you were to get caught in an alleyway with sketchy figures quickly approaching.. This is what you would want to find
            in your back pocket. Chicken salad is a wave of relief when re-discovered; Oh <em>yeah</em> this exists and I have it in my
            fridge. Cold, crisp, fierce, and crunchy. The ultimate companion whether you're cooking at grandma's or lost in a dark, scary place.
